Iron Horse 2.

Comprehensive train set with a gameplay focus.

It's mostly done and it's kind of fun.

Designed to be used with 'vehicles expire' set to to 'on', Iron Horse 2 has a *lot* of vehicles and crowds the buy menu unless expiry is used.

Earliest start: around 1860
Last new trains introduced: around 2020

Use with Termite or similar railtype set.
