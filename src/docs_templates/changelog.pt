"A horse is worth more than riches" â€” Spanish proverb

Time for Iron Horse 3.  It's the one right after Iron Horse 2.


**"Pitch me"**

*New ways to choose vehicle liveries*

- more liveries to choose from
- easier to select liveries


*Revamped tech tree*

- better progression
- fewer repeating models that only differ in paint and stats
- multiple new engines, super for gameplay


*Full use of 'vehicle variants' feature in OpenTTD 13*

- Iron Horse 3 requires OpenTTD 13 or newer
- not compatible with previous Iron Horse versions
- uses a new GRFID
- Iron Horse 1 and 2 still available as separate grfs


*Changes*

- liveries are now individual vehicle variants in the buy menu
- many new liveries added for engines, passenger vehicles and mail vehicles
- powered vehicles with dedicated trailer cars are grouped together in the buy menu
    - for example, Blaze HST coaches and mail vans will be grouped as variants with the Blaze HST power cars
- freight wagons *do not* have livery variants for Iron Horse 3.0.0, but freight wagon livery variants may be added in future
- rebalanced tech tree
    - now exactly 150 engines
        - (161 including snowploughs, cab cars, auto-trailers and similar)
    - adjusted progression of some lines, especially electric engines and high-horsepower diesels
    - added engines
        - Eastern, steam freight engine, 1250 hp, available around 1900
        - Keen, steam freight engine, 1800 hp, available around 1917
        - Yak, steam freight engine, 1000 hp, available around 1930

*Fixes*

- Magnum 70 did not display power correctly in some circumstances


*Docs*

- show variants on engine details pages


*Codechanges*

- reduce template complexity and eliminate a large number of duplicate realsprites, as OpenTTD now correctly handles offsets for flipped vehicles that are < 8/8 long

-------------
2.23.0 Release
-------------


*Changes*

- rebalanced Passenger Coaches to have lower capacity
- added Suburban Coaches with high capacity
    - speeds match railcars
    - Suburban Coaches use the alternative coach livery to make them visually distinct from Passenger Coaches
    - the livery can be toggled to match standard Passenger Coaches by depot flip (ctrl-click on the vehicle in depot)
    -  Suburban Coaches will be hidden in simplified gameplay mode
- the following railcars now have 'Suburban High Capacity' as role, and have increased capacity
    - Deasil, Slammer, Tin Rocket, Happy Train
    - Athena, Geronimo, Breeze, Zeus
- minor tweaks to narrow gauge passenger vehicle capacities
- reintroduced Restaurant Cars
    - adding a Restaurant Car to a train will provide a bonus: eliminates the running cost for all Passenger Coaches in the train

- deleted Luxury Passenger Coaches
- removed cargo aging bonus from some wagon types that were using it
- removed cargo aging malus from Passenger Coaches
- removed cargo aging malus from Metro trains

-------------
2.21.0 Release
-------------


*Changes*

- added Restaurant Cars
    - adding a Restaurant Car to a train will provide a bonus: improved run costs and payment rates for all Passenger Coaches and Luxury Passenger Coaches in the train
    - the bonus reduces run costs for those coaches by 70%
    - the bonus increases cargo aging rate for those coaches by 30%
    - the bonus is applied once only per train, adding more than one Restaurant Car will have no additional effect
    - the bonus applies only to Passenger Coaches and Luxury Passenger Coaches, not railcars, high-speed trains, mail vans etc
    - the bonus can significantly improve profits on some routes, but Restaurant Cars are expensive to buy and run...it's up to you to decide if they're worth it ;)
- rebalanced Passenger Coach and Luxury Passenger Coach purchase and run costs
- simplified cargo aging for passenger vehicles
    - Passenger Coaches are unchanged, with faster carging (roughly every 0.75 days)
    - Metro trains are unchanged, with very fast cargo aging (roughly every 0.47 days)
    - all other passenger vehicles now use the same standard value for cargo aging (every 2.5 days), where some previously had slower aging rates
    - this change simplifies balancing between passenger vehicles (and makes maintenance of the grf easier)
    - gameplay effect of this change should be negligible in most games
- renamed Luxury Railcars to Express Railcars
- minor tweaks to purchase costs of Express Railcars, Express Railcar Trailers and Railcar Trailers
- improved appearance of Blackthorn and Stentor engines

        - other wagon types can be added, but might not match appearance or speed
    - Bright Country luxury railcar adjusted to electro-diesel
        - 620 hp of diesel power
        - experimental idea, this may be of limited gameplay benefit
        - intended use is long routes that are partially electrified, with lightly-trafficked non-electrified sections, but eh, try it out
- increased capacity for standard Passenger Coaches
    - significant bump to these, e.g. 12 pax -> 16 pax in early game, 48 pax -> 64 pax in late game
    - similar increases also applied to railcars, railcar trailers and hst coaches
    - should aid gameplay with highly-connected cdist networks which tend to require high passenger capacities
    - Luxury Passenger Coaches unchanged, these match closely to original TTD capacities
- added Bolster Wagons,

2.0.0 Release
-------------


"Whoa Runaway horses...Racing through the darkness....Runaway Horses." - Belinda Carlisle

2 years in the making, Iron Horse 2 is an end-to-end rework of Iron Horse.

Same focus on gameplay.

Greatly expanded set of vehicles, strongly inspired by British trains.

All sprites redrawn.

Dive in and play.


*Recommended OpenTTD settings*

- 'Vehicles never expire: Off'
- 'Weight multiplier for freight to simulate heavy trains: 1'
- 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'
- these settings are recommended, but not required


*Improved Tech Tree*

- 6 distinct generations of vehicles
- first trains introduced around 1860
- last new trains introduced around 2022
- engines now have clear roles, displayed in buy menu
    - freight
    - general purpose / express
    - high speed / very high speed
    - high capacity urban
- engine roles depend on OpenTTD setting 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'
    - without this setting Iron Horse 2 works fine, but some freight engines will overlap general purpose / express engines
- greatly expanded range of vehicles
- some Iron Horse 1 vehicles have been kept, with new stats and sprites, all other vehicles are new
- all stats rebalanced, including speeds, power and costs
- 357 trains in total, Iron Horse 2 is designed to be used with OpenTTD setting 'Vehicles never expire: Off'


*Engines*

- added wider range of low-power, medium-power and high-power engines
    - Iron Horse 1 had gaps where there wasn't really an appropriate engine for some routes
    - medium-power engines were especially lacking in Iron Horse 1 after 1935
-  electric engine roster expanded to 16
    - 12 electric
    - 4 electro-diesel (bi-mode)
    - first electric engine available around 1905
    - Iron Horse 1 included only 4 electric engines


*Railcars*

- expanded railcars to 20
    - 16 standard gauge and 4 narrow gauge
    - Iron Horse 1 included only 3 railcars
- dedicated variants for
    - passengers
    - mail/express freight
    - Iron Horse 1 relied on refitting passenger railcars to handle mail/express freight, which was faff, and can't be used reliably with auto-refit in stations
- added electric and electro-diesel railcars
- first railcars now available around 1925
- railcar appearance will automatically adapt to consist, creating single cars, or multiple-unit trains


*High Speed / Very High Speed Trains*

- added dedicated high speed and very high speed trains
- fastest train in Iron Horse 2 is 186 mph (Brenner, available around 2018)
    - 155 mph Screamer from Iron Horse 1 is removed, these trains replace it
- maximum speed will only be available with dedicated passenger coaches
- first high speed train available around 1980
- first very high speed train available around 1987
- very high speed trains include
    - distributed power: all coaches are powered
    - tilt bonus for faster speed through curves


*Wagons and Coaches*

    - Grain Hopper
    - Fruit & Vegetables Van
    - multiple lengths for wagons and coaches, increasing visual variety
- some Iron Horse 1 wagons are missing from Iron Horse 2, but will be restored in future when sprites are finished
    - Intermodal Flat Car
    - Metal Car (torpedo wagon)
    - Supplies Car
    - Vehicle Transporter Car
- Combine Car is removed permanently, as it cannot work with OpenTTD autoreplace
- passenger coach and mail van appearance automatically adapts to consist
    - alternative liveries depending on attached engine
    - sprite variants such as brake coaches, restaurant cars, post office vans as appropriate


*Narrow Gauge Trains*

- simpler but more useful narrow gauge engine roster
- expanded narrow gauge railcars, first available around 1950
- expanded narrow gauge wagon and coach types
- narrow gauge engines and railcars are somewhat 'inspired by' French and Corsican trains, as British and Irish narrow gauge is more limited


*Metro Trains*

- sprites redrawn
- minor stats adjustments


*Improved Visual Appearance*

- reworked all sprites
- added multiple livery options for many vehicles (random, or when vehicle is flipped in depot)
- all vehicle lengths now 4/8, 6/8, 8/8, 10/8, or 12/8
    - easy to make exact tile-length trains if desired
- depot flip enabled for many vehicles (was disabled in Iron Horse 1 as a side effect of how vehicles were coded)
- more accurately positioned visual effects
- rear lights on consists
- electric vehicle pantographs are raised on electric rails, otherwise lowered

- removed the requirement that all vehicles are articulated (was used to support vehicles with sprites longer than 8/8)
- reworked graphics generation
    - automated buy menu sprites
    - automated cargo sprites
    - automated chassis and roofs
    - automated pantographs
- added shared library of cargo sprites, cargo refits etc with Road Hog and Unsinkable Sam
- refactored classes and templates
- simplified vehicle definitions, removing boilerplate and redundancy


*Known issues for 2.0.0 release*

- there may be a period during 1860s when engines are available, but no suitable wagons (or wagons but no suitable engines), this is due to randomised vehicle introduction dates and will be fixed in future
- loading speeds are unbalanced, and some vehicle types may load too slowly or too quickly, this will be fixed in future
- electric and electro-diesel engines might behave incorrectly on electric railtypes where the label isn't 'ELRL', this may be fixed in future
- Iron Horse 2 grf and docs are not published on #openttdcoop bundles server, this may be fixed in future
- Brenner cab doors do not open when loading, this will not be fixed
