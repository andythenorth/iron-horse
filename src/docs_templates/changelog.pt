**"Pitch me"**

*New ways to choose vehicle liveries*

- more liveries to choose from
- easier to select liveries


*Revamped tech tree*

- better progression
- fewer repeating models that only differ in paint and stats
- multiple new engines, super for gameplay


*Full use of 'vehicle variants' feature in OpenTTD 13*

- Iron Horse 3 requires OpenTTD 13 or newer
- not compatible with previous Iron Horse versions
- uses a new GRFID
- Iron Horse 1 and 2 still available as separate grfs


*Changes*

    - Deasil, Slammer, Tin Rocket, Happy Train
    - Athena, Geronimo, Breeze, Zeus
- minor tweaks to narrow gauge passenger vehicle capacities
- reintroduced Restaurant Cars
    - adding a Restaurant Car to a train will provide a bonus: eliminates the running cost for all Passenger Coaches in the train

2.21.0 Release
-------------


*Changes*

- added Restaurant Cars
    - adding a Restaurant Car to a train will provide a bonus: improved run costs and payment rates for all Passenger Coaches and Luxury Passenger Coaches in the train
    - the bonus reduces run costs for those coaches by 70%
    - the bonus increases cargo aging rate for those coaches by 30%
    - the bonus is applied once only per train, adding more than one Restaurant Car will have no additional effect
    - the bonus applies only to Passenger Coaches and Luxury Passenger Coaches, not railcars, high-speed trains, mail vans etc
    - the bonus can significantly improve profits on some routes, but Restaurant Cars are expensive to buy and run...it's up to you to decide if they're worth it ;)
- rebalanced Passenger Coach and Luxury Passenger Coach purchase and run costs
- simplified cargo aging for passenger vehicles
    - Passenger Coaches are unchanged, with faster carging (roughly every 0.75 days)
    - Metro trains are unchanged, with very fast cargo aging (roughly every 0.47 days)
    - all other passenger vehicles now use the same standard value for cargo aging (every 2.5 days), where some previously had slower aging rates
    - this change simplifies balancing between passenger vehicles (and makes maintenance of the grf easier)
    - gameplay effect of this change should be negligible in most games
- renamed Luxury Railcars to Express Railcars
- minor tweaks to purchase costs of Express Railcars, Express Railcar Trailers and Railcar Trailers
- improved appearance of Blackthorn and Stentor engines

    - increased Pylon diesel power to 700 hp
    - added Cargo Sprinter diesel freight railcar
        - 99 mph, 1650 hp
        - express cargo refits (mail, food, engineering supplies etc)
        - for increased capacity add Express Container Wagons, these match Cargo Sprinter speed, and will also match appearance
        - other wagon types can be added, but might not match appearance or speed
    - Bright Country luxury railcar adjusted to electro-diesel
        - 620 hp of diesel power
        - experimental idea, this may be of limited gameplay benefit
        - intended use is long routes that are partially electrified, with lightly-trafficked non-electrified sections, but eh, try it out
- increased capacity for standard Passenger Coaches
    - significant bump to these, e.g. 12 pax -> 16 pax in early game, 48 pax -> 64 pax in late game
    - similar increases also applied to railcars, railcar trailers and hst coaches
    - should aid gameplay with highly-connected cdist networks which tend to require high passenger capacities
    - Luxury Passenger Coaches unchanged, these match closely to original TTD capacities
- added Bolster Wagons,
    - looks like a flat wagon with side stakes
    - refit to 'long products' and metals industry cargos, e.g. steel, copper, aluminium, pipe, wood etc

-------------
2.12.0 Release
-------------


*Changes*

- reworked parameters for freight wagon colours and randomisation
    - added 2 'wagon base colour' parameters - optionally set freight wagons to use fixed colours instead of company colours, even in groups with colour schemes
    - added 'wagon colour randomisation' parameter, offering 3 options for randomising the colours of freight wagons

-------------
2.11.0 Release
-------------


*Changes*

- experimental 'Random Wagon Colour' parameters
    - freight wagons will randomise to 1 of 4 colours when built
    - players can use the parameters to control these colours
    - options for specific colours, or company colours 1 and 2

"Whoa Runaway horses...Racing through the darkness....Runaway Horses." - Belinda Carlisle

2 years in the making, Iron Horse 2 is an end-to-end rework of Iron Horse.

Same focus on gameplay.

Greatly expanded set of vehicles, strongly inspired by British trains.

All sprites redrawn.

Dive in and play.


*Recommended OpenTTD settings*

- 'Vehicles never expire: Off'
- 'Weight multiplier for freight to simulate heavy trains: 1'
- 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'
- these settings are recommended, but not required


*Improved Tech Tree*

- 6 distinct generations of vehicles
- first trains introduced around 1860
- last new trains introduced around 2022
- engines now have clear roles, displayed in buy menu
    - freight
    - general purpose / express
    - high speed / very high speed
    - high capacity urban
- engine roles depend on OpenTTD setting 'Enable wagon speed limits: On'
    - without this setting Iron Horse 2 works fine, but some freight engines will overlap general purpose / express engines
- greatly expanded range of vehicles
- some Iron Horse 1 vehicles have been kept, with new stats and sprites, all other vehicles are new
- all stats rebalanced, including speeds, power and costs
- 357 trains in total, Iron Horse 2 is designed to be used with OpenTTD setting 'Vehicles never expire: Off'


*Engines*

- added wider range of low-power, medium-power and high-power engines
    - Iron Horse 1 had gaps where there wasn't really an appropriate engine for some routes
    - medium-power engines were especially lacking in Iron Horse 1 after 1935
-  electric engine roster expanded to 16
    - 12 electric
    - 4 electro-diesel (bi-mode)
    - first electric engine available around 1905
    - Iron Horse 1 included only 4 electric engines


*Railcars*

- expanded railcars to 20
    - 16 standard gauge and 4 narrow gauge
    - Iron Horse 1 included only 3 railcars
- dedicated variants for
    - passengers
    - mail/express freight
    - Iron Horse 1 relied on refitting passenger railcars to handle mail/express freight, which was faff, and can't be used reliably with auto-refit in stations
- added electric and electro-diesel railcars
- first railcars now available around 1925
- railcar appearance will automatically adapt to consist, creating single cars, or multiple-unit trains


*High Speed / Very High Speed Trains*

- added dedicated high speed and very high speed trains
- fastest train in Iron Horse 2 is 186 mph (Brenner, available around 2018)
    - 155 mph Screamer from Iron Horse 1 is removed, these trains replace it
- maximum speed will only be available with dedicated passenger coaches
- first high speed train available around 1980
- first very high speed train available around 1987
- very high speed trains include
    - distributed power: all coaches are powered

    - alternative liveries depending on attached engine
    - sprite variants such as brake coaches, restaurant cars, post office vans as appropriate


*Narrow Gauge Trains*

- simpler but more useful narrow gauge engine roster
- expanded narrow gauge railcars, first available around 1950
- expanded narrow gauge wagon and coach types
- narrow gauge engines and railcars are somewhat 'inspired by' French and Corsican trains, as British and Irish narrow gauge is more limited


*Metro Trains*

- sprites redrawn
- minor stats adjustments


*Improved Visual Appearance*

- reworked all sprites
- added multiple livery options for many vehicles (random, or when vehicle is flipped in depot)
- all vehicle lengths now 4/8, 6/8, 8/8, 10/8, or 12/8
    - easy to make exact tile-length trains if desired

- improved compile speed, including very fast compiles if only sprites are changed
- removed the requirement that all vehicles are articulated (was used to support vehicles with sprites longer than 8/8)
- reworked graphics generation
    - automated buy menu sprites
    - automated cargo sprites
    - automated chassis and roofs
    - automated pantographs
- added shared library of cargo sprites, cargo refits etc with Road Hog and Unsinkable Sam
- refactored classes and templates
- simplified vehicle definitions, removing boilerplate and redundancy


*Known issues for 2.0.0 release*

- there may be a period during 1860s when engines are available, but no suitable wagons (or wagons but no suitable engines), this is due to randomised vehicle introduction dates and will be fixed in future
- loading speeds are unbalanced, and some vehicle types may load too slowly or too quickly, this will be fixed in future
- electric and electro-diesel engines might behave incorrectly on electric railtypes where the label isn't 'ELRL', this may be fixed in future
- Iron Horse 2 grf and docs are not published on #openttdcoop bundles server, this may be fixed in future
- Brenner cab doors do not open when loading, this will not be fixed
